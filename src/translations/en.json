    "roxyName": "Roksolana Dushynska",
    "roxyBio": "Roxy feels like she has been friends with Olga her entire life. Olga and Roxy were in the same friend group since middle school, but they didn't become close until senior year of high school. The magic of Goldstein's scheduling system put Olga and Roxy in almost every class together, where they started to learn that they were more similar than they thought. Their love of Sims and stress of applying to colleges brought them together in ways that they couldn't imagine. Later, they went to Baruch together, where they shared meals on the 5th floor (…the literal floor…) and where they dreamed of who they would become in the next few years. The years of Olga's friendship were some of the best ones of Roxy's life, and she is honored to be a part of Olga's and Justin's big day.",
    "ginoName": "Gino Giacoio",
    "ginoBio": "Gino and Justin have known each other since middle school, but became close friends in high school. Their 9th grade math teacher, Mr. Cerar, named them the “Bash Brothers” due to their above average math skills and rivalry in class. Both of them decided to attend Stony Brook University where Gino majored in Physics and Math, while Justin chose Computer Science and Math. Gino and Justin had virtually every math class together from 8th grade all the way through college. Both of them bonded over their love for music, video games, and competing against each other. They have formed a lifelong friendship and have been there for each other through the good, the bad, and the ugly.",

    "joshBio": "Josh met Justin on their first night at Stony Brook University in 2017. Soon after, they formed a mutual love for Cactus Cafe's shrimp burritos, and the rest is history. Josh and Justin have spent many days bonding over their (mostly unfortunate) love of the Mets and Giants, once spending five hours on the LIRR to get to and from Citi Field. Josh currently lives in Durham, North Carolina, where he works for USA Baseball.",

    "zakharBio": "Throughout most of his college career, Zakhar had the blessing of waking up in the same room as Justin and his white noise fan. Living within 20 feet of Justin for years has had a profound impact on Zakhar, enhancing his comedic talents and music appreciation while doing nothing for his computer skills. He is thrilled to probably be responsible for Justin unintentionally learning his first Ukrainian words, years before he could put them to use, starting his new life.",

Matt lives on Long Island and is currently working at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, NY. Matt and Justin both enjoy listening to hip-hop/rap and spent a lot of evenings bumping together and playing video games. One of Matt's favorite moments with Justin was staying up till midnight for several nights waiting for Kanye West to drop his new album and going to bed disappointed that it did not release. If you run into Matt later in the night, he will probably be trying to get all his friends (and possibly you) to do a Jägerbomb with him. Matt is honored to be one of Justin's groomsmen and is looking forward to celebrating Justin and Olga's special day with their friends and family.",
    "jennaName": "Jenna Santer",
    "jennaBio": "Jenna is the sister of the groom. She grew up with two brothers, and is so excited to finally have a sister in the family. Jenna knew Olga would be the perfect addition to the family when Olga gladly tagged along for the late night Taco Bell/McDonalds runs. Jenna cannot imagine a better match for Justin than Olga and she cannot wait to see what their future holds.",
